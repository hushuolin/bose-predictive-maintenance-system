# Bose Predictive Maintenance System

This README provides an overview of the Bose Predictive Maintenance System, a simplified architecture designed for data engineering demonstration purposes. This project showcases skills in data ingestion, processing, storage, monitoring, and alerting using AWS serverless services.

## Architecture Overview

The Bose Predictive Maintenance System architecture consists of the following key components:

### 1. Data Ingestion Layer
- **Amazon S3**: 
  - Acts as the starting point for data ingestion.
  - Stores raw JSON files containing product health data.

### 2. Data Processing Layer
- **AWS Lambda**: 
  - Triggered by S3 events when new files are uploaded.
  - Processes incoming data in near real-time.
  - Performs data validation, transformation, and analysis.

### 3. Storage Layer
- **Amazon DynamoDB**: 
  - Stores processed health metrics for fast access.
  - Enables quick queries for current device states.
- **Amazon S3 (Processed Data)**: 
  - Stores processed data for long-term retention and further analysis.

### 4. Notification Layer
- **Amazon SNS**: 
  - Sends alerts to the maintenance team when issues are detected.

### 5. Monitoring and Logging Layer
- **Amazon CloudWatch**: 
  - Monitors the entire system, providing metrics, logs, and alarms.

## Data Flow
1. **Raw health data JSON files** are uploaded to an S3 bucket.
2. **S3 event notifications** trigger a Lambda function.
3. The **Lambda function**:
   - Retrieves the file from S3.
   - Processes and validates the data.
   - Stores relevant metrics in DynamoDB.
   - Optionally saves processed data back to S3.
   - Sends notifications via SNS if health metrics indicate potential issues.
4. **CloudWatch** monitors the entire process, logging events and performance metrics.

## Key Features Demonstrated
- **Data Ingestion**: Handling incoming data through S3.
- **Data Processing**: Using Lambda for serverless, event-driven data transformation.
- **Data Storage**: Utilizing both DynamoDB for quick access and S3 for long-term storage.
- **Data Modeling**: Designing the schema for storing processed data.
- **ETL Processes**: Extracting data from S3, transforming it in Lambda, and loading it into DynamoDB.
- **Error Handling and Logging**: Implementing robust error handling and logging with CloudWatch.
- **Alerting**: Setting up a notification system using SNS for critical events.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Create an S3 bucket** for raw data ingestion.
2. **Set up a DynamoDB table** to store processed health metrics.
3. **Develop a Lambda function** to process the data:
   - Read files from S3.
   - Parse and validate JSON data.
   - Transform data as needed.
   - Store processed data in DynamoDB.
   - Optionally write processed data back to S3.
   - Send SNS notifications if needed.
4. **Configure S3 event notifications** to trigger the Lambda function.
5. **Set up an SNS topic** for alerts.
6. **Use CloudWatch** to monitor the system and set up alarms.

## How to Use
1. **Upload raw JSON data** files to the configured S3 bucket.
2. **AWS Lambda** will be triggered to process the incoming data.
3. **Processed data** will be available in DynamoDB and optionally in S3.
4. **Alerts** will be sent via SNS in case of detected issues.
5. **Monitor** the system through CloudWatch metrics, logs, and alarms.

## Future Enhancements
- **Scalability**: Implement partitioning strategies in DynamoDB to handle larger datasets.
- **Data Enrichment**: Integrate external data sources to enrich product health metrics.
- **Batch Processing**: Use AWS Glue for batch data processing and ETL tasks.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Utilize Amazon SageMaker to build predictive models for maintenance.

## Conclusion
This architecture demonstrates an end-to-end data processing pipeline using AWS services. It focuses on core data engineering tasks while keeping the design simple and effective. It showcases skills in handling serverless architectures, data transformation, and implementing a robust alerting and monitoring system.
